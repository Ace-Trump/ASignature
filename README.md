`ASignature` is a library for drawing smooth signatures. It uses variable width Bézier curve interpolation based on [Smoother Signatures](http://corner.squareup.com/2012/07/smoother-signatures.html) post by [Square](https://squareup.com).
It works from API 8+ and doesn't depend on any external libraries.
